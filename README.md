# Adrian's Poke Project
This project interacts with the PokeAPI found on https://pokeapi.co. The API itself contains various information regarding a Japanese media franchise named Pokemon, or Pocket Monsters, which began as a video game series and soon developed into a television series. 

This project will focus on the many fictional species, called Pokemon, who have their own information. There are a total of 905 species of Pokemon. Each has their name and assigned number. 

The core features of the MPV consist of a random Pokemon display, which can be triggered by the user through a button. There will also be a form that will allow a user to "look up" a Pokemon based on number and name by submitting the name through the form. This part will allow two Pokemon to be placed side by side to compare base statistical information.

I will use the API to obtain the information which includes names, numbers, pictures, and statistical information. The names and pictures shall be displayed through both the random Pokemon display and the form display. Additionally, the Pokemon statistics and Pokemon number identifier will also be displayed on the form display.
